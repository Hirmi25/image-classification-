<h1>Image Classification using Deep Learning (CIFAR-10)</h1>

<h3>📌 Overview</h3>
This project implements an image classification model using deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images categorized into 10 classes.

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, with backpropagation for weight optimization, the Adam optimizer for adaptive learning, and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy as the loss function. The goal is to develop an efficient image classifier with high accuracy.

<h3>✨ Features
🖼 Dataset: CIFAR-10</h3>
-Contains 60,000 images of 10 object classes:
🚀 airplane | 🚗 automobile | 🐦 bird | 🐱 cat | 🦌 deer | 🐶 dog | 🐸 frog | 🐎 horse | 🚢 ship | 🚚 truck
-Each image is 32x32 pixels, with 3 color channels (RGB).
-Data is preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to the range [0,1] for better model performance.
